# PalindromeCheckerApp
1. Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement a console-based Java application that determines whether a given string is a palindrome. The project aims to strengthen understanding of string manipulation, control structures, and user input handling in Java.

2. Project Flow

a.The application starts and displays a welcome message.

b.A menu is presented with options to check a palindrome or exit.

c.The user selects an option.

d.If the user chooses to check a palindrome:

   The system accepts a string input.

   The input is processed (spaces removed and converted to lowercase).

   The string is reversed and compared with the original.

   The result is displayed.

   The program continues until the user selects the exit option.

3. Use Cases

Use Case 1: Check Palindrome

Actor: User

The user enters a string.

The system evaluates whether the string reads the same forward and backward.

The system displays the result.

Use Case 2: Exit Application

Actor: User

The user selects the exit option.

The system terminates execution.
